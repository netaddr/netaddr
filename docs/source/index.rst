netaddr documentation
=====================

A Python library for representing and manipulating layer 3 (IP) and layer 2 (MAC)
network addresses.

netaddr's documentation uses the `Di√°taxis approach to technical documentation
authoring <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ and is organized like so:

* :doc:`tutorials` take you on a step-by-step journey through some of the netaddr's features.
  Start here if you're new to netaddr.
* :doc:`how-to` are recipes and provide steps to address common problems and use-cases.
* :doc:`reference` contains technical description of various parts of netaddr machinery
  (including the :doc:`api`).
