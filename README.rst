Provides support for:

Layer 3 addresses

-  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, subnets, masks, prefixes
-  iterating, slicing, sorting, summarizing and classifying IP networks
-  dealing with various ranges formats (CIDR, arbitrary ranges and
   globs, nmap)
-  set based operations (unions, intersections etc) over IP addresses
   and subnets
-  parsing a large variety of different formats and notations
-  looking up IANA IP block information
-  generating DNS reverse lookups
-  supernetting and subnetting

Layer 2 addresses

-  representation and manipulation MAC addresses and EUI-64 identifiers
-  looking up IEEE organisational information (OUI, IAB)
-  generating derived IPv6 addresses

Starting with Python 3.3 there's an `ipaddress <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html>`_
module in the Python standard library which provides layer 3 address manipulation
capabilities overlapping ``netaddr``.
